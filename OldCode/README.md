### Old BASIC Code ###
This folder contains scans of some very old BASIC code that I wrote in ~1999 (I think). This code was written for the "F-BASIC" interpreter of a Famicom clone similar to [this](http://www.nesworld.com/pirate-glk2003.php) one. The interpreter itself was on a cartridge similar to [this](http://www.nesworld.com/pirate/glp2.jpg) that was a part of the pacakge. The code was originally written on a few loose sheets of paper and I copied it over (almost?) as-is into a diary around 2004-05. 

The programs themselves are as follows:

* **Nov 1**: Procedure for starting the "F-BASIC" game/program
* **Nov 2**: A listing of actions performed by the various "function" keys (and howto "break" out of a running program)
* **Nov 3**: 4 programs (in order) for Reading users name and printing it, Reading two numbers and printing the sum, Reading two numbers and printing which one is the greater of two, Reading a limit and printing numbers from 1 to that limit
* **Nov 4**: Experiments with the "PRINT"/"?" statement and its results (not really a program)
* **Nov 5**: 3 programs (in order) for Reading a number and printing the doubled value, Reading a number and printing its cube-root -- seemingly this was also experiments with the `DEF FN` syntax, Reading sides of a triangle and printing the area as per [Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula).
* **Nov 6**: 2 programs (in order) for expermimenting with the `GO SUB` and `RETURN` syntax and Reading a bunch of numbers and printing their average
* **Nov 7**: 2 programs (in order) for Reading total bill amount and calculating discount and Reading Cost/Selling price and printing profit/loss status
* **Nov 8**: Program to calculate and print roots of a quadratic eqn (it doesn't handle complex roots)
* **Nov 9**: Program to calculate compound interest

### Running the Programs Today ###
The programs can be run as-is on an emulator. [Nintendulator](http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/nintendulator/?news=2016#downloads) can run the ROM in question called ["32-in-1 Study and Game"](https://www.loveroms.com/download/nintendo/study-and-game-32in1-/7233) quite satisfactorily. On Linux, the emulator itself can be run using Wine 32-bit mode.
